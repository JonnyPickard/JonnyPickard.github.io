# React Examples

> Work in Progress!

For now, please take a look at [react-audio-player](https://github.com/JonnyPickard/react-audio-player) and [vital-dashboard-app-react](https://github.com/JonnyPickard/vital-dashboard-app-react) to see examples of work.

## About

I've decided that the best way to show off a portfolio of examples is by using a component library. For this, I've chosen Storybook.

As I've been in full-time employment for a considerable amount of time, the examples currently visible on my Github are fairly dated.

My thoughts are that, by compartmentalizing using a component library, I will be able to gradually chip away at a portfolio, providing a more accurate representation of the work I'm capable of.
