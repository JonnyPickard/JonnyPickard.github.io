# Data Fetching & Caching

<time dateTime="2023-09-06">Nov 6, 2023</time>

<hr />

Over the last couple years, the React community has come to realize that "data fetching and caching" is really a different set of concerns than "state management".
While you can use a state management library like Redux to cache data,
the use cases are different enough that it's worth using tools that are purpose-built for the data fetching use case.

The most popular data fetching & caching clients/ tools, at the time of writing, can be found in the table below.

## Global State Vs Server state

Typically in complex React apps there has been a pattern of storing most of the required state
in a global state store e.g. using Redux.

- This avoids drilling props down multiple levels.
- Allows us to acess data across our application without duplicating it.
- Allows comunication between isolated components and hooks that otherwise wouldnt be able to.

As this is a useful solution, there has classically also been the pattern of adding state from the server \(i.e. from api requests\) to the store.

```ts
const globalState = {
  // Client owned state
  theme: "dark",
  alerts: [],
  menuState: "open",
  // State from the server
  todos: [...],
  books: [...],
  pcGames: [...]
};
```

### Splitting Client & Server State

#### Client State

- Non-persistent \(lasts for a session\).
- Synchronous and immediately available.
- Client-owned.

Therefor client state tends to be reliably up to date with what we want to render in the view.

#### Server State

- Persisted remotely \(hosted on a server somewhere\).
- Single source of truth location is out of our control or even potentially unknown.
- Asynchronous \(accessible via asynchronous api's\)
- Shared ownership. State can be changed at any time by other owners.

Therefor very few guarantees can be made around or server state always being up to date in our apps.
And, commonly in the view we end up relying on a snapshot of server state from a specific moment in time \(when we last fetched data\).

Because of the complexity and unreliablity of server state a huge variety of tools have been developed for the client to deal with all the various quirks.
This can quickly cause client side state management solutions to become wildy complex and hard to understand or maintain.
