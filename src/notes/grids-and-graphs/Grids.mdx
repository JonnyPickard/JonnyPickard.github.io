## Introduction

Rectangular grids are a common way to represent 2D space in various applications, including games, simulations, and more. Each cell in the grid can hold a value or represent a state.

## Representing a Grid in Code

### 2D Array Matrix Representation

We can represent a grid in code using a 2D array. This array can contain any data type but for simplicity, we'll use integers.

```js
const grid = [
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
];
```

### Object Representation (Sparse Representation)

### 1D Array (Flat Representation)

### Chunking for Large Grids

## Navigating the Grid

To navigate the grid, we can define directions and use them to move from one cell to another.

```js
const directions = {
  north: { x: -1, y: 0 },
  east: { x: 0, y: 1 },
  south: { x: 1, y: 0 },
  west: { x: 0, y: -1 },
};

const move = (start, direction) => {
  return { x: start.x + direction.x, y: start.y + direction.y };
};

const start = { x: 1, y: 1 };
const newPosition = move(start, directions.north);
console.log(newPosition); // { x: 0, y: 1 }
```
