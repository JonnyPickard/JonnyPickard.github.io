## Overview

Redux is a predictable state management library that implements a global store using a variation of the publish/subscribe pattern.

The store serves as a single source of truth: a centralized location where all application data exists only once and is the exclusive place where state can be updated or retrieved.

View components are restricted to dispatching events (representing UI interactions) and cannot modify state directly.

Redux is particularly valuable when:

- Your application has substantial state that needs to be accessed across multiple components
- State updates occur frequently throughout the application
- State update logic becomes complex
- The codebase is medium to large and may involve multiple developers
- You need to track state changes over time for debugging

## One-Way Data Flow

One-way data flow is a fundamental concept in Redux where data always flows in a unidirectional cycle:

<p align="center">
  <img src={ReduxDataFlow} alt="Redux Data Flow" width="320px" />
</p>

Following the diagram above:

1. A view component (UI) subscribes to the store, enabling it to:

   - Request necessary data (e.g., bank balance: $0)
   - Receive updates when data changes, triggering re-renders
   - Dispatch events back to the store

2. When a user interacts with the UI (e.g., depositing $10):
   - An action is created (an object containing event data)

```ts
const depositAction = {
  type: "bank/deposit",
  payload: 10,
};
```

3. The action is dispatched to the store, which determines how to update its state:

   - `Current bank balance: $0` + `$10` = `New bank balance: $10`

4. The UI receives the updated bank balance of `$10` and re-renders accordingly.

## Actions

An `Action` is a plain JavaScript object with a mandatory `type` field that describes the event that occurred.

- Actions can include additional fields with information about what happened
- By convention, this additional data is placed in a field called `payload`

```js
const addTodoAction = {
  type: "todos/todoAdded",
  payload: "Buy milk",
};
```

## Reducers

A `Reducer` is a pure function that receives the current `state` and an `action` object, then determines how to update the state if necessary.

- The store registers reducer functions during initialization/configuration

```js
const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterReducer });
```

Reducers must follow these rules:

- Calculate the new state value based solely on the `current state` + `action`
- Never modify existing state directly; always make `immutable updates` by copying the existing state
- Avoid asynchronous logic or side effects (like API calls or browser interactions)

## Selectors

Selectors are functions that extract specific pieces of data from the store.

Benefits of selectors include:

- **Reusability**: They provide a consistent way to access the same piece of derived data across different components
- **Maintainability**: They decouple components from the store structure, facilitating easier testing and refactoring

Basic example:

```ts
import React from "react";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

export const TodoListItem = (props) => {
  const todo = useSelector((state) => state.todos[props.id]);
  return <div>{todo.text}</div>;
};
```

For maintainability, it's best to define selectors as reusable functions when:

- Multiple components need to access the same piece of state
- The store structure might change in the future

It's often recommended to define reusable selectors directly in slice files rather than within components.

### Optimizing Selectors with Memoization

[Optimizing Selectors with Memoization](https://redux.js.org/usage/deriving-data-selectors#optimizing-selectors-with-memoization)

#### Context

1. Selectors used with `useSelector` or `mapState` run after every dispatched action
2. `useSelector` and `mapState` use `===` reference equality checks on selector return values to determine if a component needs to re-render

```ts
// Example 1. Causing unnecessary re-renders
function TodoList() {
  const completedTodos = useSelector((state) =>
    state.todos.map((todo) => todo.completed),
  );
}
```

> Example 1: The `map` function always returns a new array, causing the reference equality check (`===`) to fail and the component to re-render after every dispatched action, even when the todos haven't changed!

```ts
// Example 2. Re-running expensive calculations
function ExampleComplexComponent() {
  const data = useSelector((state) => {
    const initialData = state.data;
    const filteredData = expensiveFiltering(initialData);

    return filteredData;
  });
}
```

> Example 2: This expensive filtering logic will run after every dispatched action when it should only run when `state.data` changes.

#### Solution

We can use `memoization`, a caching technique, to optimize selector performance. Memoization stores the inputs and results of a function call. When the function is called again:

- If the inputs are identical to a previous call, it returns the cached result without re-executing the function
- If the inputs differ, it re-executes the function and stores the new inputs and results

The standard library for memoizing selectors is [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect), which exports a [createSelector](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect#createselectorinputselectors--inputselectors-resultfunc-selectoroptions) API for generating memoized selectors.

```ts
// `createSelector` accepts one or more "input" selectors
// and an "output" selector that transforms the input values
// An output selector should always contain transformation logic!
const selectUsersOver30 = createSelector(
  // Input selector
  (state) => state.usersList,
  // Output selector
  (usersList) => usersList.filter((user) => user.age > 30),
);
```

## Slice

A slice is a function that accepts initial state, an object of reducer functions, and a slice name. It `automatically generates action creators and action types` corresponding to the reducers and state.

```typescript
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import type { PayloadAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

interface CounterState {
  value: number;
}

const initialState = { value: 0 } as CounterState;

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment(state) {
      state.value++;
    },
    decrement(state) {
      state.value--;
    },
    incrementByAmount(state, action: PayloadAction<number>) {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

## [Middleware](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/glossary#middleware)

Redux Middleware is a higher-order function that composes a dispatch function to return a new dispatch function.

```ts
type Middleware = ({ dispatch: Dispatch; getState: () => State }) => (next: Dispatch) => Dispatch;
```

<p align="center">
  <img src={ReduxDataFlowAsync} alt="Redux Data Flow Async" width="320px" />
</p>

Middleware is primarily used for logic with side effects such as logging, routing, and asynchronous API calls.

Middleware can be composed using [function composition](https://redux.js.org/api/compose): a technique where you combine multiple functions to create a new function. The output of one function becomes the input for another.

```ts
// Function composition example:
// 1. slice(bread)
// 2. toast(slicedBread)
// 3. spreadButter(slicedToast)
// 4. addJam(butteredToast)

const makeSandwich = (bread) => addJam(spreadButter(toast(sliceBread(bread))));

makeSandwich("Sourdough Loaf");
```

### [Redux Thunk Middleware](https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-logic-thunks)

The term "thunk" describes a function that performs delayed work. Redux Thunk middleware allows you to dispatch functions instead of plain action objects.

A thunk function can contain arbitrary logic (synchronous or asynchronous) and can call `dispatch` or `getState` at any time.

```ts
const thunkFunction = (dispatch, getState) => {
  // Logic that can dispatch actions or read state
};

store.dispatch(thunkFunction);
```

For consistency with dispatching regular action objects, we typically write thunk action creators that return the thunk function. These action creators can accept arguments for use within the thunk.

```ts
const depositFunds = (amount) => {
  return (dispatch, getState) => {
    const balanceBefore = getState().balance;
    dispatch(incrementByAmount(amount));
    const balanceAfter = getState().balance;
  };
};

store.dispatch(depositFunds(10));
```

### Async Thunk

[Using Async Thunk](https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-logic-thunks#using-createasyncthunk)

Since writing async logic with thunks can be repetitive (requiring code for pending/fulfilled/rejected states), Redux Toolkit provides `createAsyncThunk` for handling async operations.

`createAsyncThunk` accepts a Redux action type string and a callback function that returns a promise. It automatically generates and dispatches actions based on the promise's status.

```ts
// todosSlice.js

export const saveNewTodo = createAsyncThunk(
  "todos/saveNewTodo",
  async (text) => {
    const initialTodo = { text };
    const response = await client.post("/fakeApi/todos", { todo: initialTodo });
    return response.todo;
  },
);

const todosSlice = createSlice({
  name: "todos",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    // omit reducer cases
  },
  // extraReducers handles actions defined elsewhere (like those from createAsyncThunk)
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(saveNewTodo.pending, (state, action) => {
        state.status = "saving";
      })
      .addCase(saveNewTodo.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.todos = [...state.todos, action.payload.newTodo];
        state.status = "save successful";
      });
  },
});
```

```ts
// NewTodoForm.js

const handleSubmit = async () => {
  await dispatch(saveNewTodo(todoText));
};
```

`saveNewTodo.pending` and `saveNewTodo.fulfilled` actions are automatically dispatched and can be handled by the todosSlice reducers.

## [Store Normalization](https://redux.js.org/usage/structuring-reducers/normalizing-state-shape#designing-a-normalized-state)

When working with relational or nested data, the resulting structure can become complex and repetitive.

This creates several issues:

- Duplicate data across the store becomes difficult to update consistently
- Nested data requires complex reducer logic that becomes harder to maintain
- Immutable updates of deeply nested objects require copying all ancestor objects in the state tree, potentially causing unrelated UI components to re-render even when their displayed data hasn't changed

```ts
// 1. Unnormalized state

const blogPosts = [
  {
    id: "post1",
    author: { username: "user1", name: "User 1" },
    body: "......",
    comments: [
      {
        id: "comment1",
        author: { username: "user2", name: "User 2" },
        comment: ".....",
      },
      {
        id: "comment2",
        author: { username: "user3", name: "User 3" },
        comment: ".....",
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

The principles of normalizing data are:

- Each data type gets its own "table" in the state
- Each "data table" stores items in an object, using item IDs as keys and the items themselves as values
- References to individual items use the item's ID
- Arrays of IDs indicate ordering

Here's how you could normalize the `blogPosts` state:

```ts
// 2. After Normalization

{
  posts: {
    byId: {
      post1: {
        id: "post1",
        author: "user1",
        body: "......",
        comments: ["comment1", "comment2"],
      },
    },
    allIds: ["post1"],
  },
  comments: {
    byId: {
      comment1: {
        id: "comment1",
        author: "user2",
        comment: ".....",
      },
      comment2: {
        id: "comment2",
        author: "user3",
        comment: ".....",
      },
    },
    allIds: ["comment1", "comment2"],
  },
  users: {
    byId: {
      user1: {
        username: "user1",
        name: "User 1",
      },
      user2: {
        username: "user2",
        name: "User 2",
      },
      user3: {
        username: "user3",
        name: "User 3",
      },
    },
    allIds: ["user1", "user2", "user3"],
  },
};
```
