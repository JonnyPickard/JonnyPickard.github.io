# HexGrid Working Notes

- [Honeycomb Hex Grid Library][2]
- [Hex Geometry][3]

## Overview

An attempt at using [ThreeJs][1] + [Honeycomb][2] to render a hex grid.

This is a learning exercise as I wanted to experiment with some hex grid coordinate systems as well as
pathing/ grid traversal algorithms.

## Mapping my Hex Mesh Geometry To A Honeycomb Custom Hex

[Custom Hexes](https://abbekeultjes.nl/honeycomb/guide/custom-hexes.html#custom-hexes)

- My hex tile mesh has `POINTY Top` geometry (In 3JS `Y` is used as `UP`).
- Bounding box Z = the dimension of the outer circumfrence of the hex.
- Dimension of the outer circumfrence of the hex is used to represent a `Size` number value.
- The width and height are defined in terms of the diameters of the two circles.
  - Flat Top Variant
    - Width = `2 x Size`
    - Height = `√3 x Size`
  - Pointy Top Variant
    - Width = `√3 x Size`
    - Height = `2 x Size`

```tsx
const CustomHex = defineHex({
  // Uses the outer circle diameter to make x/ y
  // nodes.Cylinder.geometry.boundingBox.max.z
  dimensions: 0.5553572773933411;
  // FLAT = flat top, POINTY = pointy top
  orientation: Orientation.POINTY,
  // Z is uneccessary as the hex tile grid should represent a 2d plane
  origin: { x: 0, y: 0 },
});

// hex is an instance
const hex = new CustomHex();
```

## Pathfinding

- There seem to be 3 main types people use:
  - A\*
  - Biased A\*
    - A\* is Heuristic - A function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step
      based on available information to decide which branch to follow.
  - Dijkstra

- It would be good to try out multiple but I should start with A* as it seems to be the most popular for this.
- It would be good to also display on screen the total number of loops the algorithm has to make.
- This [Hexagonal Path Finding Visualiser][4] by `Rory Sullivan` is great & along the lines of what I'm aiming to acomplish.

### Steps

- Text overlay different coordinate types?
- graphNode class = col, row, neighbours, isTerrain, distanceFromStart, isStart, isEnd
- calcHexDistance - calculate the distance between two tiles on the grid.
- graphFromGrid hex
