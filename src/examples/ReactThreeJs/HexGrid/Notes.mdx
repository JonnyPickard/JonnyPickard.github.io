# HexGrid Working Notes

- [Honeycomb Hex Grid Library][2]
- [Hex Geometry][3]

## Overview

An attempt at using [ThreeJs][1] + [Honeycomb][2] to render a hex grid.

This is a learning exercise as I wanted to experiment with some hex grid coordinate systems as well as
pathing/ grid traversal algorithms.

## Mapping my Hex Mesh Geometry To A Honeycomb Custom Hex

[Custom Hexes](https://abbekeultjes.nl/honeycomb/guide/custom-hexes.html#custom-hexes)

- My hex tile mesh has `POINTY Top` geometry (In 3JS `Y` is used as `UP`).
- Bounding box Z = the dimension of the outer circumfrence of the hex.
- Dimension of the outer circumfrence of the hex is used to represent a `Size` number value.
- The width and height are defined in terms of the diameters of the two circles.
  - Flat Top Variant
    - Width = `2 x Size`
    - Height = `√3 x Size`
  - Pointy Top Variant
    - Width = `√3 x Size`
    - Height = `2 x Size`

```tsx
const CustomHex = defineHex({
  // Uses the outer circle diameter to make x/ y
  // nodes.Cylinder.geometry.boundingBox.max.z
  dimensions: 0.5553572773933411;
  // FLAT = flat top, POINTY = pointy top
  orientation: Orientation.POINTY,
  // Z is uneccessary as the hex tile grid should represent a 2d plane
  origin: { x: 0, y: 0 },
});

// hex is an instance
const hex = new CustomHex();
```

## Pathfinding

- Heuristic: A heuristic function, also simply called a heuristic, is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step
  based on available information to decide which branch to follow.

- Look up Lerp
