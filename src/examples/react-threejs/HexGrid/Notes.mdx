## Hex Tile Geometry

[Hex Geometry](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#basics)

### Overview

- My hex tile has `POINTY Top` geometry (In 3JS `Y` is used as UP)
- Bounding box Z = the dimension of the outer circumfrence of the hex
- Bounding Box Z = `Size`
- The width and height are defined in terms of the diameters of the two circles.
  - Flat Top Variant
    - Width = `2 x Size`
    - Height = `√3 x Size`
  - Pointy Top Variant
    - Width = `√3 x Size`
    - Height = `2 x Size`

### Mapping my Hex Mesh Geometry To A Honeycomb Custom Hex

[custom-hexes](https://abbekeultjes.nl/honeycomb/guide/custom-hexes.html#custom-hexes)

```tsx
const CustomHex = defineHex({
  // Uses the outer circle diameter to make x/ y
  // nodes.Cylinder.geometry.boundingBox.max.z
  dimensions: 0.5553572773933411;
  // FLAT = flat top, POINTY = pointy top
  orientation: Orientation.POINTY,
  // Z is uneccessary as the hex tile grid should represent a 2d plane
  origin: { x: 0, y: 0 },
});

// hex is an instance
const hex = new CustomHex();
```
