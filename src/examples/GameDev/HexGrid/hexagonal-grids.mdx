## Overview

This project explores the integration of [Three.js][1] with [Honeycomb][2] to render and manipulate hexagonal grids. Much of the underlying logic draws from Amit Patel's comprehensive guide: [RedBlobGames Hexagonal Grids][3], widely regarded as the definitive resource on the subject.

**DISCLAIMER:** This implementation serves as a learning exercise and proof-of-concept for hexagonal grid coordinate systems and pathfinding algorithms. It should not be considered production-ready code but rather a foundation for further development.

## Mapping Hex Mesh Geometry to Honeycomb

[Custom Hexes](https://abbekeultjes.nl/honeycomb/guide/custom-hexes.html#custom-hexes) in Honeycomb provide the foundation for creating specialized hex tiles. When implementing these with Three.js geometry:

- My hex tile mesh uses `POINTY TOP` orientation (in Three.js, `Y` represents the vertical axis)
- The bounding box's Z dimension corresponds to the outer circumference of the hex
- The outer circumference dimension is expressed as a `Size` value
- Width and height are defined relative to the diameters of two circles:
  - **Flat Top Variant:**
    - Width = `2 × Size`
    - Height = `√3 × Size`
  - **Pointy Top Variant:**
    - Width = `√3 × Size`
    - Height = `2 × Size`

This correlation between geometric properties ensures that hex coordinates in Honeycomb properly map to Three.js mesh positions.

## Pathfinding

Hexagonal grid pathfinding typically employs one of three main algorithms:

- **A\* Algorithm** - The standard approach balancing path optimality and performance
- **Biased A\*** - A variant where the heuristic function favors certain directions
  - _Note: A heuristic function ranks alternatives at each branching step to determine which path to explore next_
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** - Guarantees optimal paths but explores more nodes than A\*

For static map layouts, more performant algorithms like [Jump Point Search (JPS)][5] can dramatically improve efficiency by skipping redundant nodes and caching sections of the graph.

[Rory Sullivan's Hexagonal Path Finding Visualizer][4] provides an excellent interactive demonstration of these algorithms in action.
