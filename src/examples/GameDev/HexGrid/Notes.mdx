# HexGrid Notes

<time dateTime="2024-02-08">Feb 8, 2024</time>

## Overview

An attempt at using [ThreeJs][1] + [Honeycomb][2] to render a hex grid.

A lot of the logic comes from this amazing guide: [RedBlobGames Hexagonal Grids][3].

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a learning exercise/ POC as I wanted to experiment with some hex grid coordinate systems as well as
pathing/ grid traversal algorithms and should not be considered production ready code.

## Mapping my Hex Mesh Geometry To A Honeycomb Custom Hex

[Custom Hexes](https://abbekeultjes.nl/honeycomb/guide/custom-hexes.html#custom-hexes)

- My hex tile mesh has `POINTY Top` geometry (In 3JS `Y` is used as `UP`).
- Bounding box Z = the dimension of the outer circumfrence of the hex.
- Dimension of the outer circumfrence of the hex is used to represent a `Size` number value.
- The width and height are defined in terms of the diameters of the two circles.
  - Flat Top Variant
    - Width = `2 x Size`
    - Height = `√3 x Size`
  - Pointy Top Variant
    - Width = `√3 x Size`
    - Height = `2 x Size`

## Pathfinding

- There are 3 main types people use:
  - A\*
  - Biased A\*
    - A\* is Heuristic - A function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step
      based on available information to decide which branch to follow.
  - Dijkstra
- If the map layout is static there are more performant algorithms that cache sections of the graph like [JPS][5].
- This [Hexagonal Path Finding Visualiser][4] by `Rory Sullivan` was a great reference.
