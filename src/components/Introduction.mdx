## Introduction

I've decided that the best way to show off a portfolio of examples is by using a component library. For this, I've chosen Storybook.

As I've been in full-time employment for a considerable amount of time, the examples currently visible on my Github are fairly dated.

My thoughts are that, by compartmentalizing using a component library, I will be able to gradually chip away at a portfolio, providing a more accurate representation of the work I'm capable of.

> Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context. That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA. - Storybook
